Written Assignment: Prepare an Abstract
---------------------------------------

During the fifth session, students will receive a set of figures and tables. Based on these data each student must prepare an abstract approximately 250 words in length that describes the data and contextualizes the importance of the findings. This assignment will be due at the beginning of our seventh session.

Final Assignment: Critically Present a Manuscript
-------------------------------------------------

During the final session, students will be tasked with presenting and critically analyzing a paper of their choosing related to one of the topics discussed in the course. These papers must be approved by the instructors by session 10 to ensure their appropriateness. This assignment will allow students to independently apply the analysis techniques learned during the course to analyze primary literature. The presentation will consist of approximately 10 PowerPoint slides, including 1–2 for background/context, 1–2 slides per figure to discuss the method and resulting data, and 1–2 slides discussing conclusions and proposing possible future work.
